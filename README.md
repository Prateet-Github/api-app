ðŸš€ In large-scale systems, API Rate Limiting & Throttling arenâ€™t optional â€” theyâ€™re core to system design.

express-rate-limit â†’ caps requests per client (mitigates brute-force attacks)
express-slow-down â†’ slows excess traffic (helps against DoS/DDoS spikes)

These strategies protect APIs, ensure fairness, and improve reliability under load.

There are two ways to handle this:
ðŸ”¹ Custom middleware (counters & timers â†’ more control)
ðŸ”¹ Packages (production-ready & faster to implement) â€” my choice here.
